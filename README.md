# Python_assignment4



In this project, we scraped the used car data from Trademe website. And save these data to a CSV file for backup. Then we did the wrangling and integration, prepare for subsequent analysis and prediction. We did some analysis of this data and find some relationship in these data. We use some predictive model to do some predict for this dataset. Prediction can help us to find a new relationship in this dataset. Finally we found out the relationship between all the data, and use the predictive model to complete a prediction application. We used C# to build the UI and connect to Python prediction script. We can enter the parameters of the used car to the application and get a predicted price.
